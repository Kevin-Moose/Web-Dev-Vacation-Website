        <p> Come explore Valbona National Park located in Northern Albania. This park
            lies within the Albanian Alps that more commonly known as the Accursed 
            mountains. Don't let the name scare you. These Mountains earned that name
            for being so insurmountable and wild. But that doesn't mean you can't 
            enjoy the view.

        <p> If you head further West you will come upon the mountains of Shkodër.
            Here you will also find mountains with tremendous heights but also flat
            plains that get softer near the coast. It offers a beautiful transition
            into the Northern coast where you can observe the Adriatic sea.

        <p> How about a change of locale and heading further South of the country 
            to explore the region of Korca. Here the mountains are vast
            but are complimented well with the surrounding lakes of Ohrid and Prespa 
            next to the Macedonian and Greek borders. The cities and towns in Korca 
            make for great trips during the Winter months.

        <p> Maybe you'd rather stay near a cozy, and warm beach in the Southern tip of
            Albania. Here you will find water so blue you'd easily mistaken it for the sky,
            and wonderful beaches that will rid every inch of stress off your shoulders. If 
            you fantasize about the beaches of Italy and Greece but hate how packed and crowded
            they are. Then consider trying out the beaches of Albania. You won't regret it.
