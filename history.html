        <p> The history of Albania begins when the Proto-Indo-European speaking people of 5500 B.C. ventured 
            into Southeastern Europe. Many different group of ethnicities would evolve from the span of 2500 years.
            The 4 major ones that are important to mention about are the Illyrians, Dacians, Thracians, and Greeks.
            It is not clear which exact group Albanians evolved from but many theories point to either Illyrian or
            Thraco-Dacian.

        <p> This is supported by the fact that the Modern Albanian language still retains Doric Greek 
            loanwords that were in use during 800-300 B.C by the Greeks. Loanwords are foreign words that enter a 
            different language through interactions between two cultures. Therefore the ancestors of Albanians had to
            have bordered the Greeks and interacted with each other either by trading, fighting, or intermixing. 
            This leaves the Thracians and Illyrians as the possible predecessor of the Albanians.

        <p> This region would often be a major crossroad into Europe for various Empires that would aspire to control it.
            The majority of Southeastern Europe would fall to the Roman Empire. During these times the Romans heavily 
            influenced and partially assimilated the Illyrians, Thracians, and Dacians. 
        </p>   
        <p>    The Dacians would over time would
            evolve into modern day Romanians who speak a full Latin language while the Illyrians would share a similar fate 
            with the exception of a few Southern Illyrian tribes who somehow retained their identity but had their culture heavily
            influenced by the Romans. Many loanwords would replace the native variants and be responsible for over 40-60% 
            of the total loanwords. This is why the language of Albania today has over 2,000 loanwords that are of Latin origin, and
            at one point was incorrectly thought to have been a Romance language.

        <p> As the Roman Empire began to crumble, all of Europe began to have a huge
            influx of migrations. The Anglo-Saxons would carve Britain, the Goths would
            take over Rome itself, and the Slavs would cause wide-spread exctinctions of 
            many cultures in the Balkans. 
        </p>    
        <p> During 500 A.D an influx of Slavic tribes pushed 
            deep into the Balkans. The Northern Illyrians would be assimilated by the Slavs,
            while the Thracians would be conquered by the Bulgars. This crisis caused any 
            surviving Balkan cultures to push further South in attempt to avoid being decimated.
            The ancestors of the Albanians would push further South into Greek territory in order
            to seek land for its refugees.

        <p> Although the West Roman Empire would fall, the East would continue to thrive.
            Over time the Byzantine Empire would flourish and unite the Greeks, Albanians,
            Anatolians, and even the invading Slavs under one banner through conquests and alliances.
            One Illyrian tribe that did manage to avoid being assimilated were the Albanoi. This is 
            where the name of Albania is thought to have originated from and lied in modern day central Albania.

        <p> Power in the Balkans would often fluctuate, but nothing would prepare the 
            Balkans for the events to come. A new group of invadors would show up to its 
            doors. During the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Turks who originally hailed from Central
            Asia would carve the Mediterranean world. Piece by piece they would conquer the Byzantine 
            Empire. One of the last regions to fall would be the territory of Albania in which a man known as Gjergj
            "Skanderbeg" Kastrioti would face an insurmountable opponent.

        <p> Kastrioti was a noble man who at a young age was given to the Ottomans 
            as a blood tax known as Devirshime. This tax would require young Christians
            within Europe to be given to the Turks for education, assimilation, and military conscription. 
            Skanderbeg would ascend the Ottoman ranks and gain the title of Skanderbeg meaning "Lord
            Alexander" in Turkish. 
        </p>
        <p> During one of the Ottoman campaigns however, Gjergj (pronounced "Gehr-gee")
            would desert the Turks and reclaim the territory of Albania that his father had 
            previously defended. The castle of Kruje would be where he would decide the fate
            of his future actions.

        <p> Over the course of the 30 years the Ottomans would test the strength of the Albanian 
            people, and its allies. Often facing 30,000 to 100,000 soldiers against Skanderbegs 5-10,000 strong army. Time
            and time again Skanderbeg would use the tactics he learned in the Ottoman army to defeat his opponent. Using feigned
            retreats, and flanking with light cavalry units he would delivery devastating blows to the Turks. The Turks would sue for peace frequently 
            to prevent losing territory after their defeats. 
        </p>
        <p> When not fighting the Turks, Skanderbeg and his forces would be employed
            by the King of Naples to settle his conflicts, which often proved victorious. Skanderbeg's own family crest would be the inspiration
            to the national flag of Albania. The crest would be inspired from the identity the Albanians had. Their 
            history with the Roman empires that favored the Eagle, as well as the war flag of the Byzantiums which
            also sported a double headed eagle.
        </p>

        <p> But just as the cycle of life continues, so did that of Skanderbeg's life. At the age of 62, Gjergj would
            succumb to Malaria and perish. Leaving behind a country without a leader. Shortly after his fall the Ottoman
            Turks would take advantage of this tragedy and take over the remainder of Albania. During this period of history
            the Albanians would undergo a massive amount of change. A large amount of Turkish words would enter the language,
            many Christians would be converted to Islam, and the country's manpower would be used to fuel the Ottoman armies.

        <p> Albanians would be under Ottoman occupation for almost half a century enduring many hardships, and having its populace 
            under constant assimilation. As the Ottoman empire weakened towards modern age, Albanians would constantly revolt 
            trying to gain more autonomy. Upon reaching the year 1912 they would finally gain full control and gain independence after the Balkan
            wars pushed the Ottoman borders all the way back to Anatolia.
        </p>    
        <p> The borders that were drawn by Western powers however, would leave almost
            1/3 of Albanians outside of the country's territory. Many wars later, the country would enter a period of Communism that isolated the 
            country from the rest of the world for half a century until its fall in the 90's. Upon this event the country would finally modernize 
            like its neighbors, form connections with countries, and open its borders to the rest of the world.

        <p> Albania today has improved tremendously. It has joined the military defense group known
            as NATO, and has been working towards joining the European Union. It has also attempted
            to warm relations with its neighbors as well as include themselves in world affairs.
            Albanians largest trading partner is Italy and Greece. These two countries are also where 
            the majority of the diaspora can be found in, accounting for over a million in Italy, and an 
            estimated half a million or more in Greece. 
        </p>    
        <p> The biggest issue concering Albania today is Kosovo.
            A region next to in which 93% of the population identify as Albanians. It is currently contested between 
            Serbia who claims the region is there's and Albania who wishes to unify with their people after a century of
            seperation. A deadly conflict in the 90's sent shockwaves across Europe and many wounds are left still healing.
