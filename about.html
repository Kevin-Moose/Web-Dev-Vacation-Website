        <p> Hello everybody! My name is Kevin M. I was born in Athens, Greece
            to ethnic Albanian parents from the Southeastern city of Korca, Albania.
            I lived most of my childhood in Athens before I migrated to the US 
            in 2001. Although I moved miles and miles away from the region I called
            home I never forgot my roots, and culture. I love my home country of Albania, and 
            the history that it has gone through. For many milleniums they have survived
            countless empires, assimilations, and invasions, and through it all it 
            still remained. This is why Albanians tend to be very patriotic and expressive
            over the love of their country and this is why I decided to make a website 
            about this beautiful hidden gem in the Mediterranean. I hope you consider it
            on your bucket list in the future. Thank you!
